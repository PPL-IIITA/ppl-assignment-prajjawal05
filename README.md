>The repository contains two folders **ques1** and **ques2** each of which contains the *Source Codes*, *Class Diagram* and the *Documentations*.
>The codes are written in cpp.

##Getting Started
>The Project was built in: macOS Sierra Version 10.12.1                      
>The Project was built using: Command Line tools in the terminal.   
>The Documentation was made using Doxygen and Latex.        
>The class Diagrams were made using StarUML.

##Prerequisities
>g++

##Building and running the codes

###Question1
>Open the Folder **ques1**           
>Create Random Test cases using the following commands:
```
g++ randomgen.cpp -o random
./random
```
>Enter the number of boys, girls and number of gifts in order and press Enter.Then:     
````
g++ main.cpp -o ques1
./ques1
````
>This will print the relationships in the console and a log.txt file will be generated containing the time stamp,event type and the description.

###Question2
>Open the Folder **ques2**           
>Create Random Test cases using the following commands:
```
g++ randomgen.cpp -o random
./random
```
>Enter the number of boys, girls and number of gifts in order and press Enter.Then:     
````
g++ main.cpp -o ques2
./ques2
````
>Enter the value of k and press Enter.       
>This will print the gift exchanges, the k most happiest and the k most compatible couple in the console and a log.txt file will be generated containing the time stamp,event type(Relationships,Gifting) and the description.
